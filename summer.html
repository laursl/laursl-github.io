            <p>I remember humid days: moisture escapes the steamed air and shapes my shirt
            to my back as we stumble to 7-Eleven down the endless, shimmering street
            under a cloudless, searing sky that presses down, makes me fight to draw the
            hot sky in my lungs and the sun paints my skin blotchy, glowing like the metal
            playground where I burnt my legs, blistered my palms on the gleaming slide
            and through the pain, I caught a flash of my cousin’s twisted laugh
            as he spat on the silver.</p>
            <p>There are dark, drenched afternoons, sparking cracks opening in the color-
            empty sky while I press my forehead against the scratched window and watch
            the fleet of scooters speed by the standstill cars and buses at every green
            light, skyscrapers reflect on the pavement, their shadows sentinel over us as
            we unfolded out of taxi back seats like anxious clowns, crumbled umbrellas in
            hands, leaping across the running streams, my aunt has a grip on my arm, her
            face is alight, she pulls me to safety.</p>
            <p>In the night market throngs of people flood the street, my mother buys me a
            glittering headband, I place it on my head and watch, the man slides a skewer
            up the back of a still-squirming shrimp and throws it twitching on the
            smoldering grill, vendors call out in Mandarin, their words too fast, I grasp at
            the sounds that swirl over me, the strain the same as when my grandmother talks,
            looking in my eyes, I give all uneasy smiles <i>this is not my home this is my
            family I don’t understand… </i> </p>
            <p>Each morning I discover a new bump where a mosquito had found me to her liking,
            her kiss raised and red. I can never catch them, they stalk in the darkness
            while we lie on itchy mattresses soaked slippery with sweat, pushing aside the
            netting and kicking tangled sheets apart, listening to the silence and heat. </p>
            <p>Buddha grins from above on the altar, there is always incense in the air;
            I forget how it smells.</p>
