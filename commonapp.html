            <p>Language is frustratingly insufficient. It is crude, forcing the imprecise and
            nuanced mind into the shallow confinement of words, leading to
            miscommunication as often as understanding. How then, as people who crave
            interaction and connection, can we be satisfied with the boundaries of
            language?</p>

            <p>I am a writer, a lover of words. They have given me power, the opportunity to
            share myself with the world. Yet, as I sit here typing, I can’t help but think of
            all that I can’t express, why I look less on paper than in my head. I know the
            frustration of being unable to put my thoughts into words, of being restrained
            by the limits of my vocabulary. I may be a writer, yet every time I listen to
            <i>“Santeria,”</i> I feel Bradley Nowell’s regret; what I really want to say,
            I can’t define.</p>

            <p>How I love the light at dawn, when it barely brushes a room. The ocean’s
            warmth around me at sunset, my brother’s smile as I walk through the door.
            My teammates screaming in joy, the weight of their familiar arms around my
            waist. My father’s tired face. Why I pause before I close a book for the last
            time. Why I cry in the car unexpectedly when a song comes on, why I hesitate
            mid-step when my left leg locks. That sudden ache in my heart, at all the
            wrong times, in all the wrong places.</p>

            <p>These things remain unknown to all but me. I will never be able to convey in
            words exactly how I feel (and “feel” itself is such an inadequate word). But like
            those before me, the authors and artists of the past, there is a part of me that
            wants to give to the world in hopes of being heard. I cannot help but try to put
            who I am into my writing, work until I can see myself reflected in the letters.
            Perhaps this is a defining character of humanity: our endless pursuit of
            connection and expression, even in the face of isolation.</p>

            <p>I know that words are imperfect. They are infuriating, demanding things—so
            touchy, really—and horribly fluid in meaning. Stringing them together in lines
            and pages requires patience and time. But I love the process, the struggle of
            finding that perfect phrase, the hours spent groaning with my head in my arms
            when a sentence just doesn’t sound right. Perhaps, if writing were easy I
            wouldn’t enjoy it at all. There is beauty in the effort that language requires,
            beauty in the sigh of relief when I have finally teased a part of myself out into
            the open and painted it into words. Beauty in the tears that well up in my eyes
            unexpectedly when I read my work. I strive for that relief, that exhilaration of
            having finally said what I want to say. I could never describe it in words, but it
            is the best feeling in the world.</p>
