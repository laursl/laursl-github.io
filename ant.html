            <p>An ant can carry fifty times its weight, but I stagger under a third
            and a thought. I drink my coffee too hot so it turns my tongue
            papery and then I can finally write. Sometimes I go to the beach
            and stand where the water brushes against the sand. I close my
            eyes and the sensation of the ground beneath my feet melting
          away makes me feel weak inside, the feeling of moving without
            moving. The ocean gives me a fleeting sort of peace, cold and
            awakening, lasting only as long as the smoothness of my
            fingertips. Better is the balm of sleep, which I seek endlessly, the
          salvation in the beaming stars, the far-flung fantasies of dreams
            chasing away the discontented waking hours. At night, I wish I
            could pull the mist over the hills just a bit farther, so it would fall
            around me as I sleep and I wouldn’t have to see the faces of the
          people hovering, and I wouldn’t have to know if they were coming
            or leaving. In the mornings, I can barely talk for fear of hearing my
            own voice. I shield my face from the harsh brightness of the
            newborn sun and attempt to insert myself into the world once
            more. Sometimes I do it successfully, and I spend the day present
            among people, winding tenuous connections to their smiles and
            hands. Other days, the air is thick so I don’t move, and I hover in a
            curious state of viewing, watching with distant, clouded eyes as
            the colors blend together like paint in water and the falling light
            wavers, turning liquid in the dust. I pay particular attention to how
            I walk now, how my legs move. I worry that if I forget to concentrate,
            I may accidentally take a wrong step, and there is no recovery from
            time, which I always thought was odd because they say that Time is
            the great healer but they forget that Time was what hurt us all in
            the first place. If I gasp like the wind is a knife, it’s because the
            cracks in my heart just grew a bit larger and the hand over my chest
            is not only holding myself together but feeling for my heartbeat,
            the one my mother listened to seventeen years ago.</p>
